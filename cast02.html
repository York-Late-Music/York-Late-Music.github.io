Duncan Honeybourne is performing his collection of Contemporary Piano Soundbites at our lunchtime recital on Saturday 6th November. During Lockdown 2020, he commissioned a series of short piano pieces (the “soundbites”) from many composers, pieces responding to the pandemic or lockdown. He is interviewed about them here.
